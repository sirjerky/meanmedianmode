Mean, Median and Mode
=======================
What are these?
Mean is the average of all the numbers.
ex. [1, 2, 3] the mean will be 2.

Median is the middle number of the group.
ex. [1, 2, 3] the median is 2. If we add another number: [1, 2, 3, 4] the median becomes the
average of the two middle numbers: 2.5.

Mode is the most common number in the group.
ex. [1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 3, 3] the mode here is 2.
